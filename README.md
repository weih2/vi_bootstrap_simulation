# vi_bootstrap_simulation

sim_1

CPU implementation of CAVI and weighted likelihood bootstrap version of CAVI

on Gaussian mixture model

sim_p1_v2

GPU implementation of CAVI and weighted likelihood bootstrap version of CAVI

on Gaussian mixture model

only useful in our research for comparing coverage rate

thousands of times faster than sim_1

sim_r2

Bayesian linear regression variational Bayes implementor

sim_3

Gibbs sampler Gaussian Mixture model

One Rcpp implementation is provided
