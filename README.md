# vi_bootstrap_simulation

sim_1
CPU implementation of CAVI and weighted likelihood bootstrap version of CAVI
on Gaussian mixture model

sim_p1_v2
GPU implementation of CAVI and weighted likelihood bootstrap version of CAVI
on Gaussian mixture model
only useful in our research for comparing coverage rate
thousands of times faster than sim_1
